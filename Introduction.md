QCV is an acronym and stands for "Quick Computer Vision". QCV is a framework for rapid development of computer vision algorithms. It is split into the following parts
  1. an application (qcv.exe) to host and run your algorithms,
  1. a class library (QCV.Toolbox.dll) containing commonly used algorithms,
  1. a class library (QCV.Base.dll) representing the core entities QCV and
  1. Third-party libraries (such as Emgu/OpenCV) providing additional data structures and algorithms.
