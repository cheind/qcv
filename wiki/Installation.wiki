#summary Getting started with QCV.

Currently the only way to use QCV is by compiling QCV yourself. To compile QCV you need to
 # install the Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1,
 # install Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2008 Express, and
 # follow the [http://code.google.com/p/qcv/source/checkout instructions] to get the source code.

If you intend to contribute to QCV you may want to optionally install [http://stylecop.codeplex.com/ StyleCop] in order to verify QCVs documentation and coding guidelines.

To compile QCV open the solution <tt>qcv.sln</tt> and make sure you select <tt>x86</tt> as platform target.

QCV may upgrade to Visual Studio 2010 and .Net Framework 4.0 in the near future. This move is motivated by the fact that Visual Studio 2008 Express editions are not available for download anymore.
