QCV is an acronym and stands for "Quick Computer Vision". QCV is a framework for rapid development of computer vision algorithms.<br>

Does the following paragraph sound familiar to you?<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Have you ever had a great idea for an algorithm but failed to implement it because setting up the environment took to much time? Have you ever felt frustrated setting up projects, managing dependencies, closing your application for a rebuilt to see the effects of the algorithm?</blockquote>

Sounds familiar? Then QCV might be for you. It provides a <b>complete environment</b> to host and run your algorithms. There is no need for an integrated development environment, since QCV supports <b>on-the-fly compilation</b>. You can keep the QCV running your algorithm while modifying it. QCV will <b>detect changes</b> to your algorithm source files and will apply those changes online.<br>
<br>
QCV<br>
<ul><li>allows you to concentrate on the <b>data flow</b> of your algorithm,<br>
</li><li>frees your mind from <b>user interface</b> questions and designing forms,<br>
</li><li>enforces a class design that encourages <b>reusability</b> of algorithms.</li></ul>
